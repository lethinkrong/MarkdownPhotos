基础任务
- 你我生命都由一连串故事组成，伟大作家书写人类集体的故事，你也会写下自己的故事。你最想分享一个故事是什么，不妨回忆一下，写在这里？140 字即可

  毕业前夕，心情烦闷，在家怼天怼地，跟我妈之间剑拔弩张。幸得一闺蜜时时连线，倾诉一二。事情步入正轨，某次与旧友相伴出游，方知那期间老妈有偷偷发信息给她请她稍作开解。心酸，回家问，老妈只佯作忘记，心酸犹甚。

- 如果想锤炼文字，但没想到故事或话题，不妨从做翻译开始：先翻译，和名家对比，再修改。现在我们来试试吧：请翻译以下《老人与海》的句子：

  >In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding.


   夜很深，老人晓得黎明就要来了。他划着船，听到一阵颤动，有鱼儿正跃出水面，嘶嘶地扇动着坚硬的翅膀，划过黑夜。他是很喜欢这些飞鱼的，视它们为海上主要的朋友。
他为那些鸟儿感到遗憾，特别是小巧精致的燕鸥，它们成天飞来飞去，寻寻觅觅，依然一无所获。
